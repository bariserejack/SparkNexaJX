## 🆘 NEED HELP?

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need a domain?**
A: No. Netlify gives you a free URL like `https://sparknexajx.netlify.app`. You can add your own domain later for $10/year.

**Q: What about the app stores?**
A: PWA doesn't need app store approval! Users just install from their phone's browser. No restrictions!

**Q: Will it work on iPhone?**
A: Yes! iOS 11.3+ fully supports PWA installation via Safari.

**Q: Can I update the app?**
A: Yes! Just update your website. Changes appear automatically. No app store approval needed!

**Q: What happens offline?**
A: Your app works fully offline. The service worker caches everything.

**Q: Can I add it to React Native later?**
A: Yes! PWA is your MVP. Build React Native app if you want native features or app store presence.
